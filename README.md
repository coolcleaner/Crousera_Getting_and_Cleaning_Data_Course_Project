# Crousera_Getting_and_Cleaning_Data_Course_Project

This repo contains the codes and results for the course project of **Getting and Cleaning Data** offered by Coursera. The data set used in this project is available at [Here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip ). The data should be downloaded and unzipped into a local folder (default: UCI HAR Dataset).

## How does it work?
The script file **run_analysis.R** should be placed in the unzipped folder of the data set (default: UCI HAR Dataset), and the execution result **tidy_data.txt** would be saved in the same folder.

## Files
* run_analysis.R
* tidy_data.txt
